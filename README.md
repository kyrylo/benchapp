A day in the life of a bench
============================

This project is incomplete: it is missing sounds. I couldn't be arsed to create
them. I did create a bunch of sounds, but I decided to delete them. I merely
wasn't happy with their quality. I don't feel motivated enough to finish this
project. By the way, the idea of the project is that on each slide a relevant
sound must be played. That is, for example, on the slide with the pissing dog,
there should be a gurgling :)
